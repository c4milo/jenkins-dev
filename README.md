# Jenkins Dev Environment

*Work in Progress*

The goal of this repo is to speed up test iterations when working on Jenkinsfile changes, as opposed to going
through our normal PR Review workflow which can take some time and be a bit frustrating to test.

Ideally, this environment should match exactly Jenkins configurations and plugin versions we use at http://jenkins.ingest.
